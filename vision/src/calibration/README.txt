1. run make_calibration_stills.py while waving board infront of camera for 20 seconds.
2. run from console calibration.py.  K and D matrices will be printed to console
3. copy K and D directly into camera.py for now

Calibration will print out an RMS value which should be below 1. To improve this value calibrate by altering pitch, roll, yaw  and distance as much as possible.
